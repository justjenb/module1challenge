## Description

This project was designed to help me gain experience with refactoring code in HTML and CSS.
This relates to a real-world problem you would encounter in the workplace working as a web developer where you need to review existing code and make improvements to it.
I learned more about grouping together CSS elements that are similar to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written and reviewed.
